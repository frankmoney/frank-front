What does it mean?\n\nOur initial function block design allowed us to work with only one possible orientation. Knowing how kids think and operate we were concerned that they might get a frustrated by connecting the function blocks in the wrong direction, but not any more!\nNow they can connect the function blocks with any orientation they would like and everything would work exactly the same!"
